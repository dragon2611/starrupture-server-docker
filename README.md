## How to use

Copy the .env.example file to a new file called .env. Then use either `docker compose` or `docker run`

### Docker compose

Starting the server with Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  starrupture:
    image: indifferentbroccoli/starrupture-server-docker
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: starrupture
    stop_grace_period: 30s
    ports:
      - 7777:7777/udp
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./server-files:/home/steam/server-files
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --name starrupture \
    --stop-timeout 30 \
    -p 7777:7777/udp \
    --env-file .env \
    -v ./server-files:/home/steam/server-files
    indifferentbroccoli/starrupture-server-docker
```

## Connecting to Your Server

1. **Start the server** using Docker Compose or Docker Run
2. **Launch StarRupture** on your gaming PC
3. **Go to "Manage Server"** in the game menu
4. **Enter your server's external IP address** (or localhost if testing locally)
5. **Create a new world** by clicking "New" and naming your server
6. **Load the world** by clicking "Load Server" and selecting your world
7. **Join the game** by going back and selecting "Join Game", then entering your server IP

## Port Forwarding

If your server is behind a router, you need to forward the following port:

* **7777** (UDP) - Game server port

For more information and instructions specific to your router, visit [portforward.com](https://portforward.com/).

## Server Management

The StarRupture dedicated server uses an in-game management interface:

1. Launch StarRupture on your PC
2. Go to **Manage Server**
3. Enter your server's IP address and password (you will set this on first connection)
4. From here you can create, load, and manage server worlds

## Volumes

* `/home/steam/server-files` - Server installation files, configuration, and save files
